# Laravel MCP

- Laravel MCP allows you to rapidly build MCP servers for your Laravel applications.
- IMPORTANT: laravel/mcp is very new. Always use the `search-docs` tool for authoritative documentation on writing and testing Laravel MCP servers, tools, resources, and prompts.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `mcp-development` every time you're working with an MCP-related task.
